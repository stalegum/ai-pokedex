# 🧠 AI Pokédex

This is an AI-powered Pokédex web app that identifies any of the original 151 Pokémon from a sprite or anime screenshot and displays detailed information such as type, ability, base stats (BST), and Pokédex entry — along with front/back/shiny sprites.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Identify Gen 1 Pokémon using AI from any sprite (Gen 1–5) or anime screenshot
- 📸 Supports front, back, shiny, and non-shiny sprites
- 🧠 Image classification powered by PyTorch & ResNet
- 🌐 Flask-based web app interface
- 📊 Shows Pokémon types, abilities, BST, and original Pokédex description

## 🖼 Example

Upload an image like:

/dataset/pikachu/front/pikachu.png

makefile
Copy
Edit

Output:

Name: Pikachu
Type: Electric
Ability: Static
BST: 320
Description: When several of these Pokémon gather, their electricity could build and cause lightning storms.

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision flask pandas pillow
▶️ Run the App
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 app.py
Then open your browser to:

http://localhost:5000
🧪 Retrain the Model (Optional)
If you add more images or update labels, you can retrain the model:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 train.py
This will generate a new sprite_classifier.pt file.

📦 Dataset Notes
Only includes Gen 1 Pokémon (Bulbasaur to Mew).

Each Pokémon has:

Sprites from Generations 1–5 (front, back, shiny, shiny back).

Screenshots from the Pokémon anime.

All data is organized into folders named alphabetically.
