IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level

Thanks for the update ‚Äî this confirms you're still running into a classic indentation mismatch in Python. It means the spacing is broken (usually mixing tabs and spaces) before line 10.

‚úÖ Quickest Fix (Recommended)
Let‚Äôs force everything to use 4 spaces only ‚Äî the Python standard.

üõ† Step-by-Step Fix
1. Open your file in VS Code or Nano:
bash
Copy
Edit
nano app.py
2. Delete all the contents
To do that in nano, press Ctrl + K repeatedly until the file is empty.

3. Paste This Clean Version
Everything below uses spaces only, no tabs:
